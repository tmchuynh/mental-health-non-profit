  preface: [
    "Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) is a complex mental health condition characterized by a consistent disregard for others' rights and social norms. Individuals with ASPD often engage in manipulative, deceitful, or aggressive behaviors, which can lead to serious legal, occupational, and interpersonal consequences. This article outlines the core features of ASPD, explores its underlying causes, and discusses therapeutic strategies and support systems for those affected.",

The condition typically begins in childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. While the behaviors may be mistaken for rebelliousness or defiance, ASPD involves a deeper disregard for societal norms and empathy. The DSM-5 requires a diagnosis of Conduct Disorder before age 15 for a valid ASPD diagnosis in adulthood.",
