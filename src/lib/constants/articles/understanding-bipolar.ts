There are several types of bipolar disorder, each with its own pattern of mood episodes. Understanding these types is crucial for effective treatment and management.",

            "Bipolar I Disorder: Characterized by manic episodes lasting at least seven days or requiring hospitalization. Depressive episodes are also common and can be severe. Individuals may also experience mixed episodes, where symptoms of mania and depression occur simultaneously.Bipolar II Disorder: Includes patterns of depressive and hypomanic episodes, without full-blown manic episodes. Hypomania is less severe than mania but can still cause noticeable changes in mood and behavior. Depressive episodes in Bipolar II can be prolonged and disabling.Cyclothymic Disorder (Cyclothymia): Involves periods of hypomanic and depressive symptoms lasting at least two years (one year in children and adolescents), without meeting full criteria for a manic or depressive episode. Symptoms may fluctuate frequently, leading to chronic instability.Other Specified and Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorders: Some individuals experience significant mood disturbances that do not fit neatly into the above categories. These cases still require careful assessment and individualized treatment.",

Some research suggests that people with bipolar disorder have changes in the size or activity of certain brain regions involved in emotion regulation, impulse control, and decision-making.Other biological factors, such as hormonal imbalances, sleep disturbances, and medical conditions (e.g., thyroid disorders), can influence the onset or course of bipolar disorder.",
