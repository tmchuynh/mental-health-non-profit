            "OCD is characterized by intrusive, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) that cause significant anxiety or distress. These obsessions lead to repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions) intended to reduce the distress or prevent feared outcomes. It is not just about cleanliness or perfectionism, which are common misconceptions. OCD symptoms can involve fears of harm, contamination, symmetry, taboo thoughts, or a need for certainty.",
            "Obsessions can take many forms, such as fears of accidentally harming others, doubts about having completed a task (like locking a door), or distressing thoughts that go against one's values. Compulsions may include checking, washing, counting, repeating actions, or seeking reassurance. Some compulsions are visible, while others are mental rituals, such as silently repeating phrases or reviewing events in one's mind.",
            "OCD can be chronic and fluctuate in severity over time. Stress, major life changes, or fatigue can worsen symptoms. Many people with OCD recognize that their thoughts and behaviors are irrational, but feel powerless to stop them. This awareness can lead to shame, secrecy, and avoidance of situations that trigger obsessions.",

These factors drive the cycle of obsession and compulsion, making it difficult for individuals to break free without intervention.",
