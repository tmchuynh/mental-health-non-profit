  preface: [
    "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) encompasses a range of neurodevelopmental conditions, including what was once known as Asperger's Syndrome. Though Asperger’s is no longer diagnosed as a separate condition under the DSM-5, many individuals still identify with the term due to its unique historical and social significance. Understanding the similarities and differences between Autism and Asperger’s can help clarify diagnostic approaches, inform support strategies, and promote more accurate awareness of the spectrum.",

It is referred to as a ‘spectrum’ because symptoms and their severity vary widely among individuals. Common traits include difficulty with social reciprocity, nonverbal communication deficits, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors. Sensory sensitivities are often present, ranging from hypersensitivity to sound, light, or touch to a lack of pain response. Early intervention and consistent support are essential to help individuals develop coping skills and achieve greater independence.",

Individuals with Asperger’s typically exhibit strong verbal skills and average to above-average intelligence, with no significant delay in language development. They may display intense focus on specific interests and struggle with understanding social cues, gestures, or tone of voice. Unlike classic autism, speech delay is not a defining feature of Asperger’s, although pragmatic (social use of language) issues are often present. Repetitive behaviors and rigid routines are common, and sensory processing difficulties may also occur.",

Cognitive ability varies across the autism spectrum; however, Asperger’s has often been associated with higher cognitive function.
