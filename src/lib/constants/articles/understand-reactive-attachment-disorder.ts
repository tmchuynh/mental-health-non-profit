  preface: [
    "Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD) is a rare but serious condition that can affect young children who have not established healthy attachments with primary caregivers. It often stems from severe neglect, abuse, or disruptions in early relationships and can result in lifelong emotional and behavioral challenges if left untreated. This article examines the roots and ramifications of RAD, focusing on how early relational trauma shapes emotional development. It aims to educate parents, caregivers, teachers, and mental health professionals on how to recognize early signs and intervene appropriately to promote healing and trust.",

            "In early childhood, healthy emotional and physical attachment to caregivers forms the foundation of a child's ability to relate to others. When caregivers are consistently responsive and nurturing, children develop a sense of safety and trust in the world. RAD arises when this attachment process is disrupted—especially in cases of severe neglect, frequent changes in caregivers, or institutionalization. Children with RAD often struggle to form meaningful emotional bonds and may show a lack of empathy or emotional responsiveness. Without early intervention, these attachment disruptions can negatively affect brain development, emotional regulation, and social functioning.",

Some children may display indiscriminate friendliness, showing attachment behaviors to strangers while being detached from caregivers. These behaviors are not due to developmental delays or autism spectrum disorders but are specific to attachment disruptions. ",
