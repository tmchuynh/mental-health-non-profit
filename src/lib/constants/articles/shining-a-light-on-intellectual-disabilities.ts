  preface: [
    "Intellectual disabilities are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that impact cognitive functioning and adaptive behavior. They can vary widely in severity and presentation, affecting how individuals learn, solve problems, and navigate daily life. This article outlines the spectrum of intellectual disabilities, identifies key causes, and presents support strategies that promote autonomy, inclusion, and lifelong growth. Understanding these disabilities is crucial for fostering empathy and creating supportive environments.",

            "Intellectual disabilities (ID) are characterized by significant limitations in both intellectual functioning—such as reasoning, learning, and problem-solving—and adaptive behavior, which includes everyday social and practical skills. The onset of these impairments occurs during the developmental period, typically before the age of 18. Intellectual functioning is generally assessed using standardized IQ tests, with scores below 70–75 indicating potential ID. Adaptive behavior is evaluated in areas such as communication, social participation, and independent living.",

Moderate ID often requires structured environments and regular support in daily tasks and decision-making. Severe and profound ID typically involve substantial developmental delays and extensive support in all areas of life. Labels of severity are less important than personalized care plans that address each person’s strengths and challenges.",

Complications during birth—including oxygen deprivation and premature birth—are also associated with increased risk. Postnatal factors such as traumatic brain injury, exposure to toxins (like lead), and severe neglect or abuse can contribute to the development of ID.
