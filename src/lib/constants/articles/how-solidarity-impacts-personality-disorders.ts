            "Individuals with personality disorders often struggle with trust and self-worth. Empathetic listening and validation of experiences create a safe environment for healing. Supportive relationships can counteract feelings of rejection and abandonment. Trust is often damaged by past experiences of invalidation or misunderstanding. When friends, family, or peers respond with patience and genuine interest, it helps rebuild a sense of safety. Over time, this trust enables individuals to open up about their struggles and accept help. Validation involves acknowledging a person's feelings and experiences without judgment. This can reduce defensiveness and foster a sense of acceptance, which is especially important for those who have felt misunderstood or stigmatized.",
