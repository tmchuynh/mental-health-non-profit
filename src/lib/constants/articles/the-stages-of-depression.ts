    "Depression is a complex mental health condition that can manifest in various stages. Understanding these stages can help in recognizing the symptoms and seeking appropriate treatment. It is important to note that depression is not a one-size-fits-all condition; it can vary significantly from person to person and may require different approaches to management. The stages of depression can vary from person to person, but they often include the following phases: mild, moderate, and severe depression. Each stage has its own set of symptoms and challenges, and recognizing where you or someone you know may fall on this spectrum is crucial for effective management and support and treatment options.

        "Mild depression is often characterized by feelings of sadness or low mood that persist for a few weeks. Individuals may experience a lack of interest in activities they once enjoyed, but they can still function in their daily lives to some extent. It's important to recognize these early signs, as they can be a precursor to more severe forms of depression if left unaddressed.",
        "Common symptoms of mild depression include fatigue, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and changes in sleep or appetite. Individuals may also experience feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness. It's essential to understand that these symptoms can vary widely among individuals, and not everyone will experience all of them.",

By providing a safe space for them to express their emotions, you can help them feel less isolated. Encouraging them to engage in activities they once enjoyed can also be beneficial. Physical activity, even in small amounts, can help improve mood and reduce feelings of sadness. It's important to remind them that seeking help is a sign of strength, and there are resources available for support. Recognizing these symptoms early can help individuals seek support and prevent the progression to more severe stages of depression. ",
            "Mild depression may also manifest as increased irritability, restlessness, or a general sense of dissatisfaction with life. Individuals might notice a decline in motivation, procrastination, or difficulty making decisions.

Emotional symptoms may involve persistent sadness, tearfulness, or a sense of emptiness. Social withdrawal can start subtly, such as avoiding invitations or reducing communication with friends and family.",
