These attacks can include symptoms such as heart palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, and a fear of losing control. The persistent worry about future attacks often leads to avoidance behaviors that impact quality of life. It is distinct from generalized anxiety disorder, which involves more constant and less intense worry.",
