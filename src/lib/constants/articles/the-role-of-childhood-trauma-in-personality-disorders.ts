Sexual abuse often leads to deep psychological scars, affecting trust and attachment. Physical abuse may include hitting, shaking, or other forms of violence that instill fear and a sense of helplessness. Chronic exposure can disrupt the development of trust and safety, leading to hypervigilance and defensive behaviors. Emotional abuse can be subtle, such as constant criticism, humiliation, or rejection. This undermines a child's sense of self-worth and can result in chronic shame, self-doubt, and difficulty forming healthy attachments. Sexual abuse often results in profound feelings of guilt, secrecy, and confusion about boundaries. Survivors may struggle with intimacy, trust, and self-identity throughout life. Witnessing domestic violence or community violence is also traumatic and can have similar effects on personality development as direct abuse.",
