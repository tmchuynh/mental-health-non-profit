      "Early intervention refers to services and supports provided to young children with developmental delays or disabilities as early as possible in life. For neurodevelopmental disorders, the earlier support begins, the greater the potential for improved cognitive, social, and behavioral outcomes. This article explores why early intervention is critical, what strategies are most effective, and how families can actively contribute to their child’s development. ",

Timely intervention can reshape neural pathways and improve the brain’s ability to process language, emotion, and motor skills. Delays left unaddressed often result in compounding difficulties that affect academic, emotional, and social outcomes. The longer a neurodevelopmental issue goes unrecognized, the more difficult it becomes to remediate effectively. Intervening early provides children with a foundation for success that becomes harder to establish later in life.",
