            "Mood disorders are a category of mental health conditions characterized primarily by disruptions in emotional state. These include major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, cyclothymia, and dysthymia, among others. Symptoms often manifest as prolonged sadness, extreme fluctuations in mood, irritability, or a lack of interest in daily activities. Because emotional symptoms overlap with many other psychiatric conditions, accurate identification requires thorough evaluation.",

            "Symptoms like restlessness, impulsivity, and difficulty focusing appear in both ADHD and bipolar disorder, which can cause confusion.
