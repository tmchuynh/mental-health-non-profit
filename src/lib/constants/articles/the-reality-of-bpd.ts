Common symptoms include fear of abandonment, impulsivity, self-harm behaviors, and rapid mood swings. It is not attention-seeking or manipulative behavior, but a deep struggle with emotional regulation and identity. Many people with BPD experience chronic feelings of emptiness and difficulties trusting others.",

Therapists work closely with patients to tailor DBT to individual challenges and progress.",
