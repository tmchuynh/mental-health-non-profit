              "NPD is a pervasive pattern of grandiosity, a constant need for admiration, and a lack of empathy toward others. Individuals with NPD often have an inflated sense of self-importance and may exaggerate achievements or talents. They may believe they are unique or special and expect to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements. Contrary to popular belief, many with NPD experience fragile self-esteem underneath their grandiosity. This can lead to sensitivity to criticism, feelings of shame, and difficulty maintaining healthy relationships. The DSM-5 criteria for NPD emphasize impairments in self-functioning and interpersonal functioning.",

Another misconception is that narcissism is synonymous with selfishness or vanity alone; NPD involves complex emotional vulnerabilities. People often believe NPD is untreatable; however, with appropriate psychotherapy, individuals can develop healthier self-esteem and relational skills. It is also inaccurate to assume everyone with narcissistic traits has NPD — many people show some narcissistic behaviors without meeting clinical criteria.",

              "NPD is believed to develop from a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. Early childhood experiences such as excessive pampering or neglect can contribute to maladaptive self-esteem regulation. Parental overvaluation or inconsistent caregiving may cause children to develop inflated self-views as a coping mechanism. Trauma and emotional abuse can also contribute by creating vulnerabilities in emotional regulation and self-concept. Not everyone exposed to these risk factors develops NPD, highlighting the role of individual resilience and other moderating factors.",

Therapy focuses on helping individuals recognize and modify distorted self-perceptions and develop empathy. Building emotional regulation skills and improving interpersonal relationships are key treatment goals. Therapists work collaboratively to reduce defensive behaviors and foster more authentic self-esteem. Medication may be prescribed to address co-occurring conditions such as depression or anxiety but is not a direct treatment for NPD. Support from family and social networks, when informed and compassionate, can significantly enhance recovery.",
