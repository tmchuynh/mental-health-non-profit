    title: "Leila’s Story",
    subtitle: "From Isolation to Empowerment",
    background: `Leila, a 24-year-old college student in Fullerton, had been quietly battling bipolar II disorder for years. The waves of depression made it hard to attend classes or maintain friendships, and manic episodes often left her feeling ashamed and misunderstood. Therapy was inconsistent due to cost, and despite being surrounded by people at school, she felt painfully alone.`,
    role: `Leila found InnerLight through a campus flyer for a “Sunday Evening Peer Circle” led by InnerLight Elevation’s volunteer facilitators. From the moment she entered the Zoom room, she was met with warmth—not clinical coldness or judgment. She listened. She wept. And then, for the first time in months, she spoke.
  
  Over the next six months, Leila became a regular. InnerLight’s trauma-informed facilitation style, grounded in peer-led empathy, helped her find the language to name her experiences without shame. She received transportation stipends and a donated laptop from the organization’s accessibility fund, ensuring she never missed a session.`,
    outcome: [
      "Leila graduated with her degree in psychology.",
      "She now facilitates the same Sunday group that changed her life.",
      "She recently helped three other students onboard into peer support.",
      "She is co-developing InnerLight’s upcoming workshop: 'Thriving With Bipolar: Beyond Diagnosis.'",
    ],
    quote: `“InnerLight didn’t just help me survive. They gave me a mirror and said, ‘You belong here—your story matters.’ I carry that with me in everything I do now.”`,

    title: "Diego’s Story",
    subtitle: "A Teen’s Turnaround",
    background: `At just 17, Diego had already been labeled a “problem student.” He missed nearly a month of school due to debilitating panic attacks triggered by crowded hallways and intense academic pressure. Teachers misunderstood his absences. His family, first-generation immigrants, had limited experience with mental health support and feared judgment.`,
    role: `Through a partnership with Jefferson High School, InnerLight launched a Mindfulness for Teens program as part of its Youth Outreach track. Diego was one of the first enrollees. Each week, he joined a 45-minute after-school session focused on breathwork, guided journaling, and peer-led reflection.
  
  InnerLight also offered a one-on-one intake with his school counselor using trauma-informed principles, coaching them to support rather than discipline. Diego was matched with a youth mentor—another teen who had previously struggled with anxiety—creating a peer bond rooted in trust.`,
    outcome: [
      "Diego went from 22 absences to perfect attendance.",
      "He learned how to regulate his breathing during hallway transitions and use grounding techniques before exams.",
      "His teachers, trained through InnerLight workshops, supported his needs constructively.",
      "Diego became an InnerLight Peer Ambassador and now speaks at youth assemblies about mental health.",
    ],
    quote: `“They didn’t treat me like a case. They saw me as someone worth investing in. Now I help other kids believe the same thing.”`,

    title: "Rashida’s Story",
    subtitle: "Reclaiming Her Voice",
    background: `After surviving years of domestic abuse, Rashida, a 39-year-old mother of two, found herself homeless, unemployed, and carrying complex trauma. With no health insurance and a deep distrust of institutions, she was caught in a cycle of silence and survival. Therapy seemed like a luxury she couldn’t afford—not a right.`,
    role: `Rashida learned about InnerLight Elevation through a pamphlet at a community shelter in Santa Ana. She was connected to the BIPOC Healing Scholarship, funded by proceeds from InnerLight’s “Light Up the Night” charity gala.
  
  She received six months of free, trauma-informed therapy with a Black woman therapist through InnerLight’s culturally matched provider network. To ensure comfort and continuity, the nonprofit covered transportation to in-person sessions and offered a child care stipend during appointment hours.
  
  Throughout her time in therapy, InnerLight case managers provided check-ins, helped with job readiness coaching, and introduced her to a peer group for survivors—where Rashida eventually shared her story, not as a victim, but as a leader in healing.`,
    outcome: [
      "Rashida secured a part-time administrative job with a local nonprofit.",
      "She regained shared custody of her children.",
      "She now volunteers with InnerLight’s outreach team, advocating for women escaping similar situations.",
    ],
    quote: `“For the first time, I didn’t have to justify my pain or minimize my story. InnerLight held space for me until I could hold it for myself.”`,

    title: "Event Spotlight",
    subtitle: "“Steps Toward Healing” Walkathon",
    background: `In October 2023, InnerLight Elevation hosted its first public walkathon at Irvine Regional Park. With over 400 attendees, this community-driven event raised $26,400 for mental health services through donations, sponsorships, and merchandise sales.`,
    role: `The event featured wellness booths, a resource tent, live music, and a memorial wall where families could honor loved ones lost to suicide. InnerLight organized, staffed, and promoted the entire walkathon through a grassroots campaign. Volunteers, donors, and partner organizations all worked together to make healing feel joyful, visible, and collective.`,
    outcome: [
      "Funded 220 hours of peer-led support sessions.",
      "Built 3 new youth programs across underserved school districts.",
      "Provided 100 free therapy sessions to low-income applicants.",
    ],
    quote: `“I walked for my brother, but I left with a new community. You made healing visible and joyful.” – Participant`,
