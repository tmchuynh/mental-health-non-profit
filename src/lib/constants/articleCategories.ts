      "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) exercises are structured techniques that help individuals identify and challenge negative thinking patterns. These exercises are designed to promote positive thinking and emotional regulation by addressing cognitive distortions.

The aim is to help individuals reframe their thoughts, resulting in improved emotional well-being and greater resilience.",

These exercises range from identifying automatic negative thoughts to more complex techniques that challenge core beliefs.
